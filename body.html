     <h2> Anorexia Nervosa </h2>
      <p> Those from anorexia nervosa or anorexia have an extremely low body weight and a strong worry of gaining weight. Drowning in the belief that they are overweight no matter how they look in the mirror and have a distorted perception of their body in general, they have a strong urge to control their body weight and size no matter the negative consequences that can happen from lack of nutrition. Anorexia can cause someone to prevent weight gain using dangerous and life-threatening measures. They severely restrict their calorie intake and may use vomiting, purging, laxatives, diet aids, diuretics or enemas to lose weight. They may also use exercise inappropriately or excessively in order to keep a slim figure.

     <h2> Bulimia Nervosa </h2>
      <p>Bulimia is a mental health disorder where an individual purges the food he or she has consumed in a forceful, unnatural manner. It is extremely common for someone with bulimia to purposefully vomit after eating, abuse weight-loss supplements and laxatives, and/or fast or exercise to excess. In most cases, those who have bulimia binge eat prior to eliminating what they have consumed.Those who have bulimia often struggle with feeling socially unacceptable in regards to their weight. They might be very insecure in their appearance and feel as though through purging food, they are in control of something. Unfortunately, this type of behavior is not only physically dangerous but psychologically damaging, too.

    <h2> Muscle Dysmorphia </h2>
      <p>People with muscle dysmorphia usually believe that their bodies are small and weak — even though many of these people are in very good shape with well-developed muscles. This means that if you have this condition, it’s likely that the idea of your body in your head and the reality of your body — specifically in terms of your muscles — don’t match.
